Security Risks from Open Ports

Port 22 (SSH) - Secure but can be brute forced if weak password or outdated
Port 23 (Telnet) - Very old, insecure and sends credentials in plain text. Should be disabled.
Port 53 (DNS) - Could be misused for DNS amplification attacks if exposed
Port 80 (HTTP) - Unencrypted; vulnerable to MITM attacks or web-based exploits
Port 1900 (UPNP) - Universal Plug and Play, easily exploited by malware if exposed

steps to be taken :
1.Disable unnecessary ports.
2.Use firewalls.
3.Use VPN and strong passwords.
